This branch is for the work ONLY on Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a good source for vectors: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-with/9781491989371/ch01.html

These functions are finished:
    setBoardArray()
    checkWin()
    isFull()
    checkCatGame()

I need to add player1Turn and player2Turn.
    The problem with this is how the imput will be given.
